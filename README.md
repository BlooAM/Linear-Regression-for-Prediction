# Description
Linear regression models for active and reavtive power were constructed based on given data. The entire data set was splitted into training and validation set randomly in the proportion of 80% to 20%, respectively. All numeric parameters (except active and reactive power) were used as predictiors. Model was trained using functions from Python Data Analysis Library - Scikit-learn.
