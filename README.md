# Test
Linear regression model.
# Description
Linear regression models for active and reavtive power were constructed based on given data. The entire data set was splitted into training and validation set randomly in the proportion of 80% to 20%, respectively. All numeric parameters (except active and reactive power) were used as predictiors. Model was trained using functions from Python Data Analysis Library - Scikit-learn. As a measure of the quality of predictions mean squared error and coefficient of determination were used. In addition, graphes illustrating the accuracy of prediction were created and saved as Active_power.jpg and Reactive_power.jpg files.
